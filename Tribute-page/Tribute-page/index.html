					<h4>Some facts about her:</h4>
					<ul>
						<p>
							Speaking on this occasion, the Collector said that the idol of the Bahujans was Sardhar
							Sarvai Papanna Goud, the first great Bahujan Emperor of India who united the Badugu and the
							weaker sections against the tyrannical rulers of that time and conquered about 32 forts in
							the Telangana region along with the Golconda fort ...
						</p>
						<p>
							Papanna lived during the period when the Mughal Empire had expanded its interests in South
							India and when tensions between the Muslim ruler Aurangzeb and his Hindu populace were
							rising. Towards the end of his life, after the death of Aurangzeb and amid the subsequent
							power struggle for succession, Papanna was able to dramatically enhance his fortunes, in
							particular as a consequence of a raid on the wealthy city of Warangal. Although of humble
							origin, he assumed some of the manners of a king.
